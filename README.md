# HIST-483-Final-Project

This is for the final project of HIST483!
Our group ended up getting an A in this course!



The House of Rice is an all asain group formed in 2018 by house mother Shay Dior and Maiden China. The group has expanded since then, with its twelve members from around the East and Southeast Asian diaspora and from different migrational generations performing and participating in activism across Greater Vancouver. The momentum of the group seems unstoppable as they hold their regular Drag and Dim Sum, and Rice Cake YVR, as well as unique events and performances, incorporating and expanding the community.

Our interviewee, Haina from China is a relatively newer member of House of Rice but has been involved much longer. Her performance stye brings her techno house influence into accepting queer spaces, keeping a refreshing and vibrant atmosphere to House of Rice events. 

Shay Diorâ€™s 2018 vision has truly become a house to be reckoned with.


What Is A Drag Show?
A drag show is an entertaining performance by artists to impersonate different characters. The artists can perform for the opposite sex, and this is why drag shows involve homosexuals and in the longer term, it involves other minority groups in the show, for instance, immigrants. The show involves comedy, singing, and dancing. The performers would wear exaggerated costumes and make-up.

The artists in a drag show can impersonate different gender so a drag show could present one's identity and desires from a complex performance from race, social class, and gender.
Typically, a drag show would perform in LGBTQ bars, nightclubs, or restaurants. Usually, a  drag king and a drag queen (male and female character) would perform in front of the audience and serve food and drink simultaneously. 

Drag shows became more and more popular in recent decades with the movie, Paris is Burning, which is a documentary film that mentions the ball culture among the minority group (LGVTQ) in New York.  Due to the promotion of films and our society becoming more open-minded, drag shows became a popular culture among teens, especially in the North American region.
